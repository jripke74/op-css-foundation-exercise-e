CSS Foundations Exercise E
Understanding how combinators work can become a lot easier when you start playing around with them and see what exactly is affected by them versus what isn't.

The goal of this exercise is to apply styles to elements that are descendants of another element, while leaving elements that aren't descendants of that element unstyled.

1.  You should see a yellow background for p elements that are descendants of the div element.
2.  You should see a text color of red for elements that are descendants of the div element.
3.  You should see a font size of 20px for elements that are descendants of the div element.
4.  You should center align text for elements that are descendants of the div element.
